I'm an aspiring, self-taught front-end developer. I'm reskilling after lots of time spent in psychology, education, and organizational development. I like to set goals, a powerful motivational construct in ed psych literature, so here are some loose goals:

## In fourty years, 
I want to look back on my work and tell myself, genuinely, that I did the best I could for those around me. Ideally, the world will not be on fire.

## In ten years, 
I want to be working at a company that creates positive social impact. Ideally, I'll still be building websites and mentoring future change-makers.

## In five years, 
I want to have a solid understanding of the past, present, and future of web development. Ideally, I'll always be learning beyond the "right now".

## In one year, 
I want to work at a company or studio that invests into the inexperienced. Ideally, they implement consistent feedback cycles, effective mentorship, and adequate time to absorb concepts.

## In one day,
I need to figure out what's for lunch. Ideally, something that involves pork belly and rice.
